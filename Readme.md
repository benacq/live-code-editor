# OVERVIEW
This an online code editor built with html css and javascript with the [ace js library](https://ace.c9.io/).
It is not fully functional though, there some few bugs in it that needs to be fixed.

### ISSUES
Please do well to clone the project and run it to actually see the issues as it might not seem exactly the way i might be describing it.
These are the two major problems that need immediate attention.

- __Language panel toggle malfunction__ 
- __Javascript execution malfunction__: When you type a javascript code, it executes as soon as the user starts typing.
The issue with this is when you are logging something to the console, every single character is printed to the console on a new line until the user is done typing.
